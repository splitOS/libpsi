## Code Style Guidelines
### All
- 4 space indentation.
- Placed in `psi`.
- Start the file with a block comment.
    - Put the name of the file in [name]: `--== [name] ==--`
    - Put a description of what the file is for.
        - If it's a source file, put "Implementations for `[sister header]`."
        - If it's a header file, put "Implementations in `[sister source file]`."
    - Example:
    ```
    /*
    --== packages.hh ==--
    This header handles the common operations with packages:
        - Installation
        - Removal
        - Purging
    Implementations in `dependencies.cc`.
    */
    ```

### Source Files
- Extension `.cc`.

### Header Files
- Extension `.hh`.
- Add header guards.
    - Example:
    ```
    #ifndef DEPENDENCIES_HH
    #define DEPENDENCIES_HH

    ... header code here ...

    #endif // DEPENDENCIES_HH
    ```
